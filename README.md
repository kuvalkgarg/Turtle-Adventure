# Turtle Trails - Map Adventures and Mini-Game Quests
This project is a turtle graphics game where the player controls a turtle character on a game board. The objective of the game is to collect all the ethereal fruits before time runs out. The player can move the turtle character using keyboard controls and interact with non-playable characters (NPCs) within the game.

# Languages and Frameworks/Libraries
The project is implemented using **Python** and utilizes the **Turtle** graphics library. Turtle provides a simple and intuitive way to create graphics and animations in Python.

# Installation and Execution
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system (version 3.x).
2. Clone the project repository from GitHub.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
```
pip install turtle
```
5. Once the installation is complete, execute the following command to start the game:
